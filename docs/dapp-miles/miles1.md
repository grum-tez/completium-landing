## Introduction

Customers of a service (transport, gaming, grocery, ...) receive miles in reward for their activity with the service: miles are received for examples, for each travel in proportion of the distance traveled; or when completing an achievement in a game; or when achieving a certain amount of purchase; and so on. Miles may then for example be traded in for gifts or cash-back, or any kind of reward.

Such miles rewarding program are put in place by Marketing departments to retain customers.
## Dapp

This Dapp example provides the Tezos's smart contract for miles management, and a web interface to interact with the contract.

In this example, each mile has an *expiration date* beyond which it cannot be consumed.

Follow these instructions to know how to interact with the Dapp.
