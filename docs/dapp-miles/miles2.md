The Use Case scenario of the 'Fidelity program' DApp is two-steps:

* Create miles associated to a user account (as the smart contract's admin)
* Consume Miles in the Dapp user interface (as a user)
## Smart contract's admin account

In order to create miles, it is required to register the smart contract's admin account in the wallet.

The process is two-steps:
* download the admin faucet file (<Link to="/docs/dapp-tools/accounts#admin-account">instructions</Link>)
* import it in wallet (<Link to="/docs/dapp-tools/thanos#import-faucet-file">instructions</Link>)

It is suggested that you name that account "Admin" for ease of use.

## User account

In order to consume miles, it is suggested that you use a dedicated test user account.

The process to create a new user account is two-steps:
* download a new faucet file from faucet site (<Link to="/docs/dapp-tools/accounts#create-test-account">instructions</Link>)
* import it in wallet (<Link to="/docs/dapp-tools/thanos#import-faucet-file">instructions</Link>)

It is suggested that you name the account "Completium Dapp user" for example.
